| Jlink                       | Can    | I have been heavily involved in the Cardano ecosystem for 2+ years and I found out about Ergo about 1 year ago. I did not get much involved with the community until lately when I saw that the Ergo ecosystem is starting to boom, just like Cardano back in the day.

| Kilver                      | Can    | I’m active on Twitter promoting Ergo daily. I have joined the Ergo community in April 2022, mainly participating in the NFT space being involved with Ergoats, CyberCitizens, Ergnomes and Ergo Champions and many others. I am also involved with Reddit collectable avatars so I managed to create a relation with many Polygon, Solana and Ethereum community members and I do actively try to promote Ergo’s ecosystem to people within that group.
